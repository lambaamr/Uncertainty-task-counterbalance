  <h2>Debriefing</h2>
  <p>We are interested in how people make decisions in different economic situations. We have been running this study for a while, and while you played a game with other mTurkers, some participants have wondered if these people are in fact real. They are indeed real. However, it is important for us to know whether you doubted if the other players were real or not.</p>

        <p><strong>Final Debriefing:</strong> In this study, we are interested in how people make decisions in different economic situations. Given how the task is set up, we couldn’t be upfront about every aspect of this study. However, we want to be totally transparent with you now about the goals and details of the experiment. Because we wanted to see how you make decisions that would impact another person, we told you that you were completing this session with a partner. However, in reality, you were not playing with someone who had previously come into the lab, but with a computer that made random decisions. This is because it is very costly and administratively difficult to bring in multiple participants.</p><p>If you have further questions about the study, or if you would like to let us know about how you are feeling about what you’ve done today, please let us know.</p>
