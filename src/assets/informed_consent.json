  "risks": "<p>Computer-based and physical experiments only involve operating a desktop computer or handling small objects. The tasks involved in these experiments can require some mental effort, and you may therefore experience some fatigue during the experiment.</p><p>There is a risk that you may find some of the visual or auditory stimuli in today’s session distressing or uncomfortable.</p><p>There exists a potential risk of embarrassment should your responses in this study become publicly associated with your identity. This risk is minimized in the following ways: 1) data we collect from you that could be used to identify you is stored separately from data that contains your responses in this study; 2) anonymized study IDs are assigned to your responses instead of direct identifiers on all study documents; 3) access to data that could be used to identify you is strictly restricted to trained members of the research team; 4) any data that is shared with other researchers will be completely anonymized and analyzed only in aggregate, so that you can never be personally identified from shared data.</p>",
  "rights": " <p><strong>Taking part in research is voluntary.</strong> You do not have to be in this study if you do not want to be. Even if you decide to be in this study, you can change your mind and stop at any time.

Personal identifiers will be kept in our electronic database until the conclusion of the study, or until you indicate that you no longer wish to participate in this study.</p><p>Data may be digitally shared with other researchers.
